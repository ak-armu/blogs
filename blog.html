            <p class="bg-secondary text-light p-4"><b class="text-dark">Ans:- </b> __Session storage is similar to localStorage, the difference is that while data in local storage doesn't expire, data in session storage is cleared when the page session ends. Whenever a document is loaded in a particular tab in the browser, a unique page session gets created and assigned to that particular tab</p>

            </h3>
            <p class="bg-secondary text-light p-4"><b class="text-dark">Ans:- </b> __The event loop has one simple job to monitor the call stack and the callback queue. If the call stack is empty, the event loop will take the first event from the queue and will push it to the call stack, which effectively runs it. Such an iteration is called a tick in the event loop.</p>

            <p class="bg-secondary text-light p-4"><b class="text-dark">Ans:- </b> __<span class="text-warning">Global Scope:-</span> &nbsp;The variables defined outside of any function or curly brackets are known as global variables and have global scope. Global scope means that the variables can be accessed from any part of that program, any function or conditional state can access that variable. <br>
            <span class="text-warning">Block Scope:-</span> &nbsp;Block scope is also a sub-type of local scope. The block scope can be defined as the scope of the variables inside the curly brackets {}. Now, these curly brackets can be of loops, or conditional statements, or something else. You are only allowed to refer to these variables from within the curly brackets {}.

            <p class="bg-secondary text-light p-4"><b class="text-dark">Ans:- </b> __undefined is a property of the global object. That is, it is a variable in global scope. The initial value of undefined is the primitive value undefined.In all non-legacy browsers, undefined is a non-configurable, non-writable property. A variable that has not been assigned a value is of type undefined. A method or statement also returns undefined if the variable that is being evaluated does not have an assigned value. A function returns undefined if a value was not returned.</p>
